// The worker functions in this file was optimized for performance. If you make changes
// you should use care to consider all of the interesting cases.

// The code of all worker functions in this file is written twice: Once as as a slow loop, and the
// second time as a fast loop. The slow loops handles all special cases, throws exceptions, etc.
// The fast loops attempts to blaze through as fast as possible with optimistic range checks,
// processing multiple characters at a time, and falling back to the slow loop for all special cases.

// This define can be used to turn off the fast loops. Useful for finding whether
// the problem is fast-loop specific.
